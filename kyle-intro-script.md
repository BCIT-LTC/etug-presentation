Good morning everyone!

> How’s everyone doing today?

“The Robots are Coming!”

> Anyone else scared of AI?

We’re not alone – Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking have said they’re afraid of it too…

Today, we’re not talking about AI as such, but we did want to showcase our journey about how we’ve brought things like automation, simplification, standardization and transparency into our course production (or development) process.

We are the course production team; I’m Kyle, this is Felicia, Karl and Mike. We basically take content from a variety of people – instructors, subject experts and instructional designers – usually in Word format, and we process it, upload it into an LMS and then build out the rest of an online course.

This timeline shows our role in a typical online course project from idea to the point where it goes live in front of students. You can see we’re close to the end, and depending on the complexity of the project, our courses can take anywhere from 4 and 15 months.

So today, we’re going to walk you through our journey of how we set out to improve and automate our work, and share some of our challenges and successes and things we’ve learned. We want to keep this panel-style discussion really casual so please stop us at any point if you have a question – just put up your hand so we know.

A couple of years ago it was pretty clear that we needed to re-think the way we converted content. Essentially, we were a bottleneck. A lot of people were sending us their content and because there was only a few of us, we couldn’t process it fast enough. There was quite a bit of frustration.

So we set out to find a way to leverage technology to build a more scalable and standardized process. We also wanted to shift and develop more of a continuous improvement culture and adopt more iterative and agile methods of working.
