# Taming the Chaos
`Where's my stuff, estimation, FIFO, production board, Need to better manage urgent tasks, forecasting`


## Story (Pain Point) (Felicia)
`Where's my stuff`

> How do you scope the production time for online courses?
> Are you able to guess how long it will take?

* People wondering about the status of their project - Where's my stuff???
	* individual course producers bore the brunt of people's frustration
		* We couldn't estimate delivery times
			* course developers didn't see the content until the last minute
			* Rule of thumb: 1 module per day
			* Really big vs really small modules

		* untransparent work prioritization
			* workload was only known to them
			* inconsistent method of deciding who's work gets done for competing deadlines
			* Squeaky wheel - the loudest gets their stuff done first


## Solution (Kyle)
`Estimation, FIFO, production board`

* Started with more accurate task estimation
	* Broke monolith course projects into more granular tasks
	* Calculated estimates based on actual content vs assumed content
	[Calculator demo](https://ltc.bcit.ca/startup)

* Built a calculator to:
	* calculate consistent time estimates for common tasks
	* improve accuracy
	* inform / defend how long it takes to complete a task

* Established a First-in-first-out queue
	* Put up a Kanban-style production board
	[Production Board](https://ltc.bcit.ca/courseproduction/)

* Board located prominently and openly
	* based on LEAN principles like
		* limited WIP (tasks worked to completion)
		* visual workflow

	* intent is to communicate a task's current place in line
	* bonus = we took pictures to get a recorded history of workload

* For those urgent / fast-tracked tasks like
	* prototype modules or revisions
		* require management approval

> Did you notice that the production board looks different now than it did in the beginning?

* It's evolved as we tweak the flow


## Lessons (Mike)
`Need to better manage urgent tasks, forecasting`

* We're realized we still need to better manage last-minute, unexpected and urgent tasks
* It's still hard to turn away work from people in a panic
* We've made some great strides in our capacity and efficiency
	* increased project completion
	* reduced task completion time

* Need better solution for forecasting upcoming work
* Easy to estimate a task but still difficult to estimate delivery date
